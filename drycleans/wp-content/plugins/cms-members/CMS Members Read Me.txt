= How can I limit viewers of my post? =

Just insert your text in these tags:

1) [onlymembers]: means only registerd members can see the text e.g. [onlymembers]Something for members[/onlymembers]
2) [onlypaid]: means only non-free plans can see the text e.g. [onlypaid]Something for golden, premium, silver members [onlypaid]
3) [onlyplans=planID]: means only defined plans(up to 5) can see the text e.g. [onlyplans=2,3]Somthing for premium and golden members[/onlyplans]
4) [nonmembers]: means only non-members can see the text e.g. [nonmembers] Please login to see full text! [/nonmembers]
 
Note: Search engines and site admin can see all of the post 
Note: Admin can not see [non-members] [/non-members] content

= Does CMS Members use standard WordPress APIs? =

Yes, CMS Members uses standard WP APIs so you can easily use WP settings or other membership plugins. For example you can define default role in WP options page or manage members in standard users page or use other membership plugins. 

We suggest using theme my login plugin with CMS Members.

<li><a href="http://Yourdomain.com/deposit/" title="Deposit">Deposit</a></li>

<li><a href="<?php echo wp_logout_url(); ?>" title="Log out from this account">Log out</a></li>
<?php } ?>

Note: Every member will see only his/her own pages. Non-members can not see anything!

Simply add values to URL for example:

provide for a specific plan. X is plan ID (e.g. 3 for golden plan)

global $user_ID;
if (X!=get_usermeta($user_ID,'planid')) {
deactivate_plugins(dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__)).'/'.basename(__FILE__));
wp_die( "Please upgrade your account to get this great plugin!" ); }

== Installation WordPress version ==

While doing the installation procedure, it is recommended to go through all the steps first before viewing the output. If you don't, you'll get nasty error messages.

1. Upload `cms-members` directory  into the `/wp-content/plugins` directory

---wp-content/plugin/cms-members/
---wp-content/plugin/cms-members/include/
---wp-content/plugin/cms-members/wwm-register.php
---wp-content/plugin/cms-members/ *** Other files ***

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress admin panel.

3. That's all

Now take a look at http://yoursite.com/register/.


== Installation MU version for WPMU/BuddyPress ==

1. Upload `cms-members-mu.php` into the `/wp-content/mu-plugins` directory

2. Upload `cms-members` directory into the `/wp-content/mu-plugins`. 

-----mu-plugin/cms-members-mu.php 
-----mu-plugin/cms-members/include/
-----mu-plugin/cms-members/catpcha/
-----mu-plugin/cms-members/wwm-register.php
-----mu-plugin/cms-members/ *** Other files ***

IMPORTANT: If your directory has a version number (e.g. cms-members.16) please remove digits and dot first.

3. To use with BuddyPress, go to BP directory open bp-core.php on line 55 change 'register' to something else e.g. join,signup-now,etc (But NOT signup and register)
